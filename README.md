# dpm-finder

This repository contains a Python script designed to identify metrics in Prometheus that exceed a specified rate. It's particularly useful for detecting metrics with high data points per minute (DPM) rates, which can be indicative of issues or important trends.

## Overview

The `dpm-finder` script retrieves a list of all metrics from a Prometheus instance, calculates their data points per minute (DPM) rate using PromQL, and identifies metrics whose DPM exceeds a threshold. The script writes these high-DPM metrics to a text file for further analysis.

## Functionality

The script does the following:

1.  **Retrieves all metrics** from a Prometheus instance using the `/api/v1/label/__name__/values` endpoint.
2.  **Calculates DPM rate** for each metric using a PromQL query: `count_over_time({metric_name}[5m])/5`.
3.  **Filters metrics** based on a DPM threshold (metrics with DPM > 1 by default).
4.  **Writes results** to a text file named `metric_rates.txt`, listing metrics that exceed the threshold.

## How To
1.  ## Create .env with the following variables.  

Please note the prometheus endpoint should not have anything after .net. 

See .env_example 

```bash
PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT=""
PROMETHEUS_USERNAME=""
PROMETHEUS_API_KEY=""
```

2. Install all libraries from requirements.txt

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

3. Run the script

``` bash
./dpm-finder.py -t 4 -f csv 
```


## Usage

```bash
usage: dpm-finder.py [-h] [-f {csv,text,txt,json,prom}] [-m MIN_DPM] [-q] [-t THREADS]

        DPM Finder - A tool to calculate Data Points per Minute (DPM) for Prometheus metrics.
        This script connects to a Prometheus instance, retrieves all metric names,
        calculates their DPM, and outputs the results either in CSV or text format.
        Results are filtered to show only metrics above a specified DPM threshold.
        

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -f {csv,text,txt,json,prom}, --format {csv,text,txt,json,prom}
                        Output format (default: csv). Note: "text" and "txt" are synonyms
  -m MIN_DPM, --min-dpm MIN_DPM
                        Minimum DPM threshold to show metrics (default: 1.0)
  -q, --quiet           Suppress progress output and only write results to file in CSV mode
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of concurrent threads for processing metrics (minimum: 1, default: 10)
```
## Notes

Adjust threads upwards to utilize more parallelism for potentially faster run times. 

File format "prom" will output prometheus exposition style metrics that could be forwarded using Alloy's prometheus.exporter.unix "textfile" collector.
